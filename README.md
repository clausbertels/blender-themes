Themes I found online and tweaked to my liking. On Windows, I really love Inter Regular https://rsms.me/inter/ on Full Hinting to improve Blender's look as much as possible.

### Piano White
Based on Kame404's https://github.com/kame404/blender-themes. I hope to eventually get this into official Blender as they don't have an actual Light theme yet. Blender Light is more of a high- contrast theme.
